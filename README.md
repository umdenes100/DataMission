# DataMission
Example Code for the data mission

## Building a new black box: 
1.3D print the CAD Part<br/>
2.Attach copper two pads to the shaft.<br/>
3.Connect a ground pin from the arduino to the top copper pad<br/>
4.Connect pin 7 from the arduino to the lower copper pad<br/>
5.Connect the 5v from the battery to the switch and then to the arduino<br/>
6.Connect the ground from the battery to the ground from the arduino<br/>
7.Place the arduino and the battery in the CAD Diagram<br/>

## Data Write:
Load this code onto the arduino. When the switch is turned on and the arduino recieves power, the program will continuously print the message onto the copper pads.
